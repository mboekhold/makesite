Hi, Iâ€™m Miguel.
</p>
<p>
I have a broad experience in what makes up most modern tech stacks. I started at the cloud infrastructure level, managing hardware and ensuring continuous operability.
I eventually gained interest in the technologies that were hosted there and decided to get into software development.
It has been endless exploration and enjoyment since then.
I hope to grow my expertise in building scalable backend services and learning the technologies that help shape the future.

I love programming, reading and kite boarding
